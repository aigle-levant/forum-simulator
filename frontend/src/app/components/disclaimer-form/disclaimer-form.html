            This is to certify that you, the end user, are liable to the following conditions:

            1. You may not submit:
            - Personally identifiable information (PII). This includes (but
            is not limited to) phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, contact information, identifiying
            documents, bank account number, etc.
            - Financial/medical data
            - Links to unmoderated platforms (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
            - Illegal, discriminatory and harmful content.

            2. Your content may be used to generate the content in this website for your personal entertainment
            for the following fields: title, content. By using this service, you agree to have your
            information stored and used by large-language models. You may, however, opt-out of future training via
            email request.

            3. You warrant that:

            - Content is original or you have redistribution rights
            - Does not infringe copyright/trademark
            - Does not defame third parties

            4. You acknowledge that Forum Simulator:

            - Is not affiliated with Reddit, StackOverflow, or Meta.
            - Uses synthetic/sanitized data
            - May retain moderated content for legal compliance
        </p>
        }
        @else if (activeBox===2) {
        <p>
            This is to remind you, the end user, that:

            - Whatever you submit in the form after this message will be used to feed my models for generating
            the following: title, content.

            - DO NOT write any Personal Identifying Information (examples could be your phone number, email, bank
            account no.,
            identifying documents, your mom's maiden name, etc.). Respect your own privacy, it's cool! If you want to
            use any sorta
            emails, phone numbers for that content (you tryhard), just ask!

            - If you submit any (I repeat, any) content and then come around crying 'I want it removed!',
            understand that I'll literally not be able to help you out of this mess. Sorting through +10k submissions,
            looking up that particular content, then deleting it is a painstaking process. I'm really sorry, bud.

            - If you want your submission to stay outta the grubby hands of my models, feel free to email me at
            aiglelevant&#64;gmail.com. (Like asking a cat to return a dead bird, but weâ€™ll try).

            - Don't you DARE post any sorta illegal, harmful, doxxable, discriminatory content. I'll remove it, and
            expect no mercy from my end.

            - This is a forum simulator. It's not a copy of Reddit, LinkedIn, etc. Please don't sue me. Any
            resemblance is a pure coincidence, I swear.

            - Never, ever use WhatsApp or Telegram as source links (will result in removal + ban). I know.

            Thank you for feeding my models. I'm assure they appreciate your help!
