I got my first tech internship because of dei (the engineering undergrads at the internship was exclusively women OR minority men). My first exposure to dei in tech was when cornell sent me a likely letter where the thesis was essentially “you’re a woman in stem, please don’t commit anywhere else just yet”. I have always wondered if after the very obviously diversity internship program, that all the offers and interviews came in because of my gender. The only time I did leetcode was when I was a sophomore before the dei internship. All the dozens of interviews I got in junior year were laughably easy. I think the hardest one was nqueens and even that’s not a hard problem. Back then I just thought I was lucky. I started working at G full time and even then it was fine, mostly because there’s fewer people who actually tries on my team. When I started at a another firm tho I realized that most guys are significantly better than I was and I’ve always wondered if I’m kept around because it looks bad to fire me :( I get that vibe from a few people on my team"

        It was 9:17 AM. I was headed to a high-stakes client meeting. Espresso in one hand, pitch deck in the other. Confidence? Off the charts.
        
        Then it happened.
        
        A rumble. A betrayal. A full-on code brown.
        
        Most would panic. I did too. But then — clarity struck.
        
        🚽 Lesson 1: Always Prepare for the Worst
        Just like I should’ve scoped out the nearest restroom, your sales team should always anticipate objections before stepping into the room. “What’s your ROI?” is the client’s way of testing your internal plumbing.
        
        🩳 Lesson 2: Change Fast
        Sometimes, your solution stinks. Accept it, pivot, clean up, and come back fresher. I found new pants. You can find new positioning.
        
        🧻 Lesson 3: Bring Extra Sheets
        Whether it’s product documentation or Charmin UltraSoft, backups save deals — and dignity.
        
        💼 I walked into that meeting 20 minutes late, in gift-shop joggers, smelling faintly of lemon sanitizer — and I still closed the deal. Because authenticity sells.
        
        Be real. Be resilient. And always carry wet wipes.

        Rushing between meetings, I knocked over a juice onto my MacBook.
        
        Panic. Frustration. Existential dread.

        “You know what? This MacBook isn’t the value. I am.”
        
        🧃 I am the juice.
        🧃 I am the processor.

        Don’t let tech define your worth.
        Remember: the hardware may spill, but the human runs deep.
