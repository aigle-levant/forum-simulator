## About the project

> It all started with me scrolling Reddit at a stormy night, reading a bunch of posts about [I believe it was a satire sub]. I notice how, among all the comments [be it passive, aggressive, or passive-aggressive], one thing was common - **they had *too many* similarities!**
>
> The very thought lead to me developing, creating and maintaining this project over time. So, welcome to Subreddit Simulator.
